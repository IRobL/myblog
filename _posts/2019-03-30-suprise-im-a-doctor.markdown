Yes, that is the kind I'm talking about!  So in this post, I just want to cover an increase in my own personal efficiency.  I'm carefully researching the beneficial effects of being near to **lemon eucalyptus and mentha x piperita.**  So far exposure is actually pretty **profound**.  Although is it...  

I'm also on a diet that is consisting of fewer and fewer grams of sugar which may be related.  I'm also off gluten... There's a lot going on that could impact me.  Who knows what it is, bodies are super weird.
