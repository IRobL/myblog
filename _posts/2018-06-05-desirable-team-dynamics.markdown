## Intro

After working in the software industry for as long as I have, I've come to the understanding that engineers are more often than not complex people, and in some cases are terrifically odd.  I shared a conversation with the manager of a hair salon a while back, and as we were talking I realized it's pretty much a 1:1 parallel between the hair style industry and the Software world.  Hair styling is talent based.  You don't leave an academic institution with a PHD or something and show up to your first job knowing how to use a pair of scisors to make someone's average head of hair look amazing.  That's an actual talent that you develop with two ingredients: personal interest in the pursuit and legitimate experience with the labor.  As it turns out, that's pretty much how software engineering works too.  Don't get me wrong, I know some great engineers who have masters degrees and all that, but the academic insitution they went to wasn't where they built their skills, rather it was their personal work on the side and internships that helped that made them great.  I'm totally digressing here...

So the manager and I were talking about how the hiring process goes in her shop, and she actually does hiring the way start-ups do.  The team gets a chance to meet the candidates, and they have a chance to air any concerns they may have about working with these perspective collegues *before* the hiring process concludes, things get plain out of hand and talent begins to flee the disrupted atmosphere of the shop.  That's on the extreme of end of the worst case scenario spectrum but let's face it there are hair stylists and engineers out there who are straight up bonkers who any rational human being would avoid working with.  I keep taking this sharp digressive hooks...  I need to brush up on my writing quite a bit...

So what are some of the cliche problems with hair stylist candidates?  Drug issues, difficult personallities, and inability to do the work.  That's exactly how it works in Software, only we prefer to use the phrase "Not having a good work life balance" as a critique over blatantly calling out people's drug habits.


## IDK

So what do I look for in a team?  In the right environment, I'm something of a hard worker.  Naturally I don't like to carry a bunch of people who are less skilled than me, full of crazy BS and ideas, but still share my job title (or worse, are a notch above --something that happens frequently to people like me who are lousy at the  job interview process.  I at least like them to not BS that they have superior ideas than me.  I'm not always right about stuff, but that's what `consensus` is for.  I feel as though consensus is the ultimate conflict resolver, and consensus works for free.


## How Consensus Works

Wikipedia described it best years ago as that defined that "Consensus is NOT voting."  I think this is the most valuable definition because the most influential component of teaching someone consus is that, no, they don't already know what consensus is, because consensus is different from voting.  Here's my favorite, more thorough definition of consensus:

| Consensus decision-making is a group decision-making process that seeks the consent of all participants. Consensus may be defined professionally as an acceptable resolution, one that can be supported, even if not the favorite of each individual. Consensus is defined by Merriam-Webster as, first, general agreement, and second, group solidarity of belief or sentiment. It has its origin in the Latin word cnsnsus, which is from cnsenti meaning literally feel together. It is used to describe both the decision and the process of reaching a decision. Consensus decision-making is thus concerned with the process of deliberating and finalizing a decision, and the social and political effects of using this process. - Game Theory Applications in Network Design

I really like this idea in theory, but it requires that the members of the team take the time to consider alternative ideas to their own, and apply their critical thinking skills to determine the merits and demerits of said ideas, put their personal feelings aside, and then communicate their professional opinions to their team mates.  Each of those tasks stands on it's own as a difficult to master activity. So ultimately, unless its explicitly written into the teams process, this kind of collaboration doesn't just happen.

## The Alternative

The alternative seems to be to repeat one's self to the extent that all other's repeating themselves are too exhaust, or until you yourself lose interest in repeating yourself.  I guess that's as far as this entry goes =/
