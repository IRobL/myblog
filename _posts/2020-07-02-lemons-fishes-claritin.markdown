I'm finding myself with tons and tons of energy after a long slump.  Part of the slump is likely related to a house project that's taking forever, but part could have been trying gluten free and losing tons of weight.  

###### Coffee
Anyway, my solution is to do 32 oz of coffee mon - fri; on saturday do 1 cup of kruig; and on Sunday, zero coffee and tons of naps.  This makes it so Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday are guaranteed to be pretty productive, even late into the day.  

###### Foods
I'm taking chewable Claratin in the morning (for fish allergy) and eating salmon every Tuesday, Thrs, and Sun.  I'm drinking Orange Juice after work to backpedal from Coffee in the evenings.

###### Work Habits
I've also switched back to workoholism, which replaces all vide-gaming that isn't purely socially purposed (I'm taking a break from the house project).  

###### Activity
I've also gone back to exercising.
